## The modal keybinding manager

## The Problem
- You have Ctrl-Alt-Shift Pinky Syndrome (Like I do.)
- You're tired of typing the same long-ass command over and over again.
- You want emacs 'Major Mode' style functionality in neovim.

## The Solution
- Dynamically rebind commands to to different keymaps
- Save and load keybinding profiles
- Constrain profiles by filetype or project
