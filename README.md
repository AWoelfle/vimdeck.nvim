## The modal keybinding manager

## The Problem
- You have Ctrl-Alt-Shift Pinky Syndrome (Like I do.)
- You want to push buttons and make things happen, but you forgot a character in your command.
- You want emacs 'Major Mode' style functionality in neovim, without the commitment.

## The Solution
- Dynamically rebind commands to to different keymaps
- Save and load keybinding profiles
- Constrain profiles by filetype or project

## Roadmap
- [ ] Telescope Integration
- [ ] Interactive creation of new profiles
- [ ] per-project & per-language binding recognition & assignment
- [ ] UI Improvements
- [ ]
